## Set default packages at startup. The first six packages are R
## default. From there on are other packages you want to append at every
## startup.
R_DEFAULT_PACKAGES='datasets,utils,grDevices,graphics,stats,methods,lattice'
# In local .Rprofile files you can append other packages, maintaining
# this settings. To do this, use in your local .Rprofile:
# source("~/.Rprofile")
# options(defaultPackages = c(getOption("defaultPackages"),
# 	"pkg1", "pkg2", [...]))
# The source (...) is needed to load the global .Rprofile. Note that if
# you don't source it, then only the local .Rprofile will be read, since
# the local has priority on R startup

## This option is only necessary for SSDs and when /tmp is set to RAM
## DO NOT USE IT IN NORMAL HDs
# TMPDIR=/var/tmp
